# Bacterial RBA models

This repository stores the RBA models of:
- *Bacillus subtilis 168* WT strain
- *Escherichia coli K12* WT strain
- *Escherichia coli* strain fixing CO<sub>2</sub>
- *Ralstonia eutropha* H16 (also known as *Cupriavidus necator*)

All models have been created using RBApy (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2019.06.001).

Models of B. subtilis and E. coli were developed by INRAE, please cite (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2019.06.001) when using these models.

The model of Ralstonia eutropha was developed by M. Jahn (https://github.com/m-jahn). Please cite (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.69019) when using this model.
